## Setting up a GitHub account

During the course we will need a GitHub account. With the GitHub account we
will be able to sign in to two other services
([Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) and [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org)).  The motivation for using GitHub
and these services is to provide a real life hands-on experience using tools
with massive traction and network effect.

We recommend that all participants who do not yet have a GitHub account,
[create one](https://github.com/join) before the workshop starts.

This account can later be removed, if desired, according to the instructions given below.


## Instructions for removing accounts

You may wish to remove the projects and
accounts that we have created.  Here we list instructions for how to achieve
that:


#### [GitHub](https://github.com)

- [Deleting a GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/articles/deleting-a-repository/)
- [Deleting a GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/deleting-your-user-account/)


#### [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)

At the moment it is not possible for a user to delete their Travis CI account directly from their account settings.
However, you can send an email to support@travis-ci.com and ask them to delete your account. They are very responsive and
will help you with the account deletion.


#### [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org)

- [Deleting a Read the Docs account](https://readthedocs.org/accounts/delete/)
