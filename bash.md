# Bash

## Installation on Linux

The default shell is usually Bash, but if your machine is set up differently
you can run it by opening a terminal and typing `bash`. There is no need to
install anything.


## Installation on macOS

The default shell in all versions of macOS before "Catalina" is Bash, so no need to install
anything. You access Bash from the terminal (found in
`/Applications/Utilities`). The default shell on macOS "Catalina" is zsh which will work
equally fine for our purposes.

Watch the [tutorial for installing the Shell, Git, and Nano on a Mac for a Software Carpentry Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LQhwETCdwY)
(copyright Software Carpentry) for an example on how to open the terminal.

You may want to keep the terminal in your dock for this workshop.


## Installation on Windows

Watch the [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=339AEqk9c-8)
(copyright Software Carpentry).

First download the [Git for Windows installer](https://git-for-windows.github.io).

Then run the installer and follow these steps:

- Click on "Next".
- Click on "Next".
- Choose "Nano" as the editor (unless you know you prefer vi or notepad++)
- Keep "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" selected and click on "Next".
  If you forgot to do this programs that you need for the workshop will not work properly.
  If this happens rerun the installer and select the appropriate option.
- Click on "Next".
- Click on "Next".
- Keep "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings" selected and click on "Next".
- Keep "Use Windows' default console window" selected and click on "Next".
- Click on "Install".
- Click on "Finish".

If your "HOME" environment variable is not set (or you don't know what this is):
- Open command prompt (Open Start Menu then type `cmd` and press [Enter])
- Type the following line into the command prompt window exactly as shown: `setx HOME "%USERPROFILE%"`
- Press [Enter], you should see `SUCCESS: Specified value was saved.`
- Quit command prompt by typing `exit` then pressing [Enter].

This will provide you with both git and bash in the git bash program.
