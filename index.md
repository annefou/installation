## Accounts

A couple of accounts are needed during the course. The motivation
for this is to provide a real life hands-on experience using tools with massive
traction and network effect.  

We recommend that all participants who do not yet have user accounts on the following 
platforms create new accounts before the workshop starts:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
- [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/)
- [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/)

These accounts can later be removed, if desired, according to the instructions given below.

## Instructions for removing accounts

You may wish to remove the projects and
accounts that we have created.  Here we list instructions for how to achieve
that:


#### GitHub

- [Deleting a GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/articles/deleting-a-repository/)
- [Deleting a GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/deleting-your-user-account/)


#### Travis CI

At the moment it is not possible for a user to delete their Travis CI account directly from their account settings.
However, you can send an email to support@travis-ci.com and ask them to delete your account. They are very responsive and
will help you with the account deletion.


#### Coveralls

You can remove projects and delete your account. To achieve this,
read section "CANCELING" on [https://coveralls.io/legal](https://coveralls.io/legal).


#### Read the Docs
